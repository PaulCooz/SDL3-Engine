# SDL3-Engine

my first steps in cross platform and graphics development

## Stack

- SDL3 as main
- Vulkan/DirectX12/WebGpu as graphic api

# TODO

- drawing images
- android build
- platform agnostic building (CMake + python)
- check for memory leaks and performance
- add hight level wrapper (like C# or typescript)
